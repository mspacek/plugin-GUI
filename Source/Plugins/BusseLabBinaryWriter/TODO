TODO:

- handle aux and ADC oe chans - need to add auxchans field to .dat.json
    - what does the clock divider ratio do? should change the ADC chan sampling rate, but doesn't seem to? Maybe force it to always be 1 for now?
    - getBitVolts() for ADC chans is different, and seems ~1000x off?
    - yes:  case DataChannel::AUX_CHANNEL: return "mV";
            case DataChannel::ADC_CHANNEL: return "V";
            default: return "uV";
        - from RHD2000Thread::getChannelUnits
        - also, see RHD2000Thread::setDefaultChannelNames() for in.gain
        - also see getAdcBitVolts
- push bandwidth, dsp, noiseslicer, clockdivider round-trip fixes and tweaks to dev branch
- push spike chan display labels and values written to disk to dev branch
- test audio monitor
    - make clicking on LFP viewer chan or Spike Viewer chan change audio to that chan
- test CAR before spike detector
- test spike detection and saving
    - add some kind of automatic threshold level setting?
    - add spike ticks to LFP viewer chans?
    - make spike detector editor use actual chan IDs instead of chanis (e.g. single electrode 1)
- make ENTER in message window save the message, so don't need to hit SAVE button
- check assumption that there's only one spike detector in the signal chain
- how does clustering work? does it fill the cluster id field in .spikes.npy properly?
- add git rev to .json/.msg.txt?
- get "Error in Rhd2000EvalBoard::readDataBlock: Incorrect header." randomly, won't exit
- why can't splitters be deleted?
- sometimes rearranging chans in the chanmap segfaults
- store last used file open path in settings.xml
